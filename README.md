# Introduction
My CPU simulator. This is a large scope project, where I implement a CPU simulator in Rust.
This is a partial port of a CPU simulator I had to build for university, which was written in C++. However it's not strictly a port as that implementation has flaws, and I build this project in hindsight.

# Dependencies, Building and Running
